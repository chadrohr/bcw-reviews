    <h1>Chad's Wk1 Journey</h1>
    <p>First, I'm enjoying myself and the challengces presented.  The learning curve is quite high as you know from my lack of previous experience in the coding arena. <br>
        I find that during class presentations the information makes logical sence but once I apply it to pracital use the lack of confidence arises and I become lost.  <br>
        I have had a few instances after school (at home) where I have spent several hours trying to figure out why my code is not working. With that said anxiety has been building due to the <br>
        speed of the information and hoping that I will have the ability to provide for my family after class is over. <br><br>

        The classroom environment and your intruction is excellent.  I simply need to find a way to remember the information.<br><br>

        Best
        Chad</p>
